- ✅ Password matching (password and confirm password must match)
- ✅ Duplicate email prevention (no two users with same email)
- ✅ Secure password hashing (SHA-256 before storage)

**User Flow**:
1. New user clicks "Sign up" on login page
2. Fills out registration form (name, email, phone, passwords)
3. System validates all inputs and checks for duplicates
4. Password is hashed and user is added to database
5. Success message shown and redirected to login page
6. User can now login with email and password
7. Authenticated users can access checkout and place orders

**Environment Setup**:
To set custom admin credentials, create a `.env` file with:
```
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your_password_hash
```

To generate a password hash:
```python
import hashlib
password = 'your_secure_password'
hash_value = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
print(hash_value)
```

**⚠️ Production Requirements**:
For production deployment, implement:
1. Backend database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for persistent user storage
2. Proper session management with secure JWT tokens
3. Server-side authentication validation
4. API rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
5. HTTPS encryption for all communications
6. Secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2 instead of SHA-256)
7. Email verification for new signups
8. Password reset functionality
9. Account management features (profile editing, password change)

**Note**: Current authentication is suitable for DEMO/DEVELOPMENT only!
